Project Title: NYC Taxi Tip Prediction ModelClient: New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)Objective: Develop a machine learning solution to increase driver revenue by identifying "generous tippers" (tips $\ge$ 20%).MethodologyData Source: 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data (~22k records).Feature Engineering: Engineered 300+ features, including pickup/dropoff time bins (am_rush, pm_rush), trip duration means, and predicted fare amounts.Modeling: Evaluated Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.Selection Metric: F1-Score was chosen to balance the cost of false positives (driver disappointment) and false negatives (missed revenue).Key FindingsThe Model: The Random Forest model achieved an F1 score of 0.72 and an accuracy of 68.7%.Impact: The model correctly identifies ~78% of generous tippers (Recall), providing drivers with a significant advantage over random chance.Top Predictors: VendorID, predicted_fare, and mean_duration were the strongest indicators of whether a passenger would tip generously.
